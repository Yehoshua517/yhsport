This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

Learn more about IDE Support for Vue in the [Vue Docs Scaling up Guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/tooling.html#ide-support).

My inspiration comes from this Youtube Video [How To Make A Portfolio Website Using Vue JS 3 , Vite , Tailwind CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U10h8rrPe6g&list=WL&index=2&t=244s)
